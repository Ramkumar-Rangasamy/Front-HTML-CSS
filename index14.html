      Do  you picture a metallic humanoid in a spaceship in the distant  imagine a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved by its robot

        <p>A humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with 
        human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, 
        humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for 
        example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. 
        Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans. History The concept of a humanoid robot originated in many 
        different  cultures around the world. Some of the earliest accounts of the idea of humanoid automata date to the 4th century BCE in 
        Greek mythologies and various religious and philosophical texts from China. Physical prototypes of humanoid automata were later 
        created in the Middle East, Italy, Japan, and France.</p>

       <p class="divpara1">Robots will increase economic growth and productivity and create new career opportunities for many people worldwide. 
      However, there are still warnings out there about massive job losses, forecasting losses of 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, or how 
      30% of all jobs could be automated by 2030.</p>

       <p>Browder says the ultimate goal of his creation is to make legal representation free and accessible. However, given the current legal 
       barriers, he doesn't have plans for commercialization soon. "This courtroom stuff is more advocacy," he explained to CBS. "It's more to 
       encourage the system to change."  He's also aware that "there are a lot of lawyers and bar associations that would not support this." 
       Nicholas Saady, a litigator at Pryor Cashman who advises on using AI in business and legal practice, said that Browder's plan risks 
       violating state laws requiring lawyers to be licensed."Is it the unauthorized practice of law?" he asked Politico. In his opinion, people 
       are better off hiring real-life lawyers, no matter how advanced the AI gets. Without the ability to read body language or make strategic 
       decisions in real-time, "It doesn't seem like AI is ready to get on its feet in court," he said.</p>
